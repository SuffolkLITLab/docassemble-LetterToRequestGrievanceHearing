question: |
  Grievance Hearing Demand Letter for Tenant Filing a Grievance.
subquestion: |

  If you have public housing and need to file a grievance with your housing authority, this interview will help you draft the demand letter you need send.  Before you start this interview, you will need information about your housing authority and their address.
  
  ### A grievance procedure can help resolve disputes with your housing authority in two different ways:
  
  * To oppose some action that a housing authority is taking against you. For example, your housing authority wont let you add someone to your lease.
  
  * To hold your housing authority staff and board accountable for the way they have acted or not acted. For example, your housing authority will not respond to a request to make repairs.
  
  *For more information, Mass Legal Help has a [grievance process guide](https://www.masslegalhelp.org/housing/lt3-your-grievance-process.pdf) on their website*
